Hello! Today, we will learn the most adventurous story ever produced in the history of mankind.
This is the story of Bob the Badger.

Since time immemorial, Bob has been living in the tunnels of the UW-Madison campus, relaxin' in

Emily got really scared of Bob so she called UW-Madison police officer about this incidence

Charles replies, "It will be alright. I have the icecream that he might like. Come on, let's go." And they are covered by the shadow of the tunnel...
