Hello! Today, we will learn the most adventurous story ever produced in the history of mankind.
This is the story of Bob the Badger.

Since time immemorial, Bob has been living in the tunnels of the UW-Madison campus, relaxin' in
 the warm steam of the tunnels, devouring fresh Union Utopia Babcock Icecream(his favorite) while
 he browsed through a fine collection of memes on the UW-Madison Memes for Milk-Chugging Teens
 facebook page, but as all great stories go, something tragic happens...

One day one of the UW-Madison students named Emily saw Bob without knowing any story about Bob in the steam tunnel while she was working. Bob asked for a money but she would just pass frowing. And she would told her coworker that she saw someone in the tunnel. The coworker did not believe her and also told her that steam tunnel is only allowed for the workers. Emily got really scared of Bob so she called UW-Madison police officer about this incidence
