Hello! Today, we will learn the most adventurous story ever produced in the history of mankind.
This is the story of Bob the Badger.

Since time immemorial, Bob has been living in the tunnels of the UW-Madison campus, relaxin' in
 the warm steam of the tunnels, devouring fresh Union Utopia Babcock Icecream(his favorite) while
 he browsed through a fine collection of memes on the UW-Madison Memes for Milk-Chugging Teens
 facebook page, but as all great stories go, something tragic happens...
